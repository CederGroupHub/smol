    A :class:`ClusterSubspace` is the main work horse used in constructing a
    cluster expansion. It is necessary to define the terms to be included in a
    cluster expansion. A cluster subspace holds a finite set of orbits that
    contain symmetrically equivalent clusters. The orbits also contain the set
    of orbit basis functions (also known as correlation functions) that
    represent the terms in the cluster expansion. Taken together the set of all
    orbit functions for all orbits included span a subspace of the total
    function space over the configurational space of a given crystal structure
    system.

    The :class:`ClusterSubspace` also has methods to match fitting structures
    and determine site mappings for supercells of different sizes in order to
    compute correlation vectors (i.e. evaluate the orbit functions for a given
    structure).

    You probably want to generate from :code:`ClusterSubspace.from_cutoffs`,
    which will auto-generate the orbits from diameter cutoffs.

    """PottsSubspace represents a subspace of functions using only indicator functions.

    A PottsSubspace is a related model to a standard ClusterSubspace used to build
    a standard cluster expansion. The only difference is that the single site functions
    for any orbit are only made up of indicator functions (and there is no constant
    function). As such it is more closely related to a generalized Ising model or better
    yet an extension of the q-state Potts Model (hence the name).

    The orbit functions in a PottsSubspace represent the concentrations of all possible
    decorations (species occupancies) of clusters in the given orbit. Similar to a
    ClusterSubspace with site indicator basis functions. But in contrast, the Potts
    subspace includes the concentration of all possible decorations (minus 1).

    Although quite similar to a ClusterSubspace, there is no mathematical
    formalism guaranteeing that the orbit basis functions generated in a
    PottsSubspace are a linear independent set spanning configuration space.
    Actually if all orbits up to any size (or infinite size) are included,
    the corresponding orbit function set is an overcomplete/ highly redundant.

    A PottsSubspace can be created directly with a ClusterSubspace object
    by using the constructor and providing the appropriately constructed orbits,
    but that is a bit more painful that just using the class method here.
