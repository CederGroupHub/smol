"""Implementation of SiteSpace and functions to get spaces and allowed species.

Implementation functions to generate lists of site spaces and allowed species
for a given disordered strucuture.

A site space is made up of the allowed species and their concentrations
including special species such as vacancies. A site spaces makes up the domain
of a site function and many site spaces make up the space of configurations.
