"""Definitions for site functions spaces.

The product of single site functions make up a cluster/orbit function used to
obtain correlation vectors. The domain of a site function is a site space,
which is defined by the allowed species at the site and their measures, which
is concentration of the species in the random structure)
Site function spaces include the basis functions and measure used to define the
inner product for a single site. Most commonly a uniform measure is used, but
this can be changed to use "concentration" biased bases.
