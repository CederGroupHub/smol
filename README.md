![CircleCI](https://img.shields.io/circleci/build/gh/CederGroupHub/smol/master?logo=circleci&style=for-the-badge&token=96d0d7a959e1e12044ff45daa43218ae7fa4303e)

Lighthweight but caffeinated implementations of computational methods for statistical mechanical calculations of crystalline material systems.

#### Credits
* Will Richards - A good amount of the Cluster Expansion code is based on Will's cluster expansion module in the pyabinitio repository
* Daniil Kitcheav - The LNO example data was computed by Daniil for his departure CE-MC tutorial
