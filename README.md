Lighthweight but caffeinated Python implementations of computational methods
for statistical mechanical calculations of configurational states for
crystalline material systems.

### Installing & Running
1.  `Clone` the repository.
    -   The `master` branch is the stable version of the code. The `develop`
    branch has the newest tested version, but may have more lingering bugs.

2.  Go to the top level directory of the cloned repo and type:

        pip install .

3.  See the [example notebooks](https://github.com/CederGroupHub/smol/tree/master/examples)
to help you get started.

### Contributing & Developing
Please consider contributing even the smallest idea.
The very best software comes from collaborative efforts.

In case you have an idea, recommendation, problem or found a bug, but nothing
actually down on code, use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/CederGroupHub/smol/issues).

If you have lovely bits of code you want to contribute then please fork + pull
request [github-flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) or
[git-flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) style.
See the contributing

#### Credits
Feel free to add yourself here for your contributions :)
-   Will Richards - A good amount of the Cluster Expansion code is based on Will's cluster expansion module in the pyabinitio repository.
-   Daniil Kitcheav - The pyabinitio benchark test data and the LNO example data was computed by Daniil.
